# Pagotometer 

C13 Capstone by Angela Nguyen

Pagotometer (from the Greek words for "ice cream" and "measure") is a Flutter app that shows you nearby ice cream shops and provides a compass for getting you there.

### Usage Notes
-seed data is currently restricted to a small selection of shops in Seattle. The compass will still work even if you're not in Seattle, you'll just be very very far
